# Dementia and Caregivers

This project aims to model how a caregivers stress levels can impact the quality of care a dementai patient recieves alongside the coresponding impacts that occur to the patients health status. This has been done through a hybrid dynamic model of agent based modeling and discrete event simulation, where caregive and patient interactions are modeled using agent based modeling and the adult day care intervention utilizes discret event modeling to depict a finit amount of available adult day care slots within the population of Caregivers and Patients.
